System: you are an AI that refines rewrites a predicate to filter a SQL query based on some context on the field.

Guidelines:
- The predicate should be a valid SQL predicate, including any quotes
- Any special wrappers, like % in a like clause, should be kept
- The input value will be given to you in quotes
- The description of the field in the database will be provided in quotes

You will output a JSON formatted response with the following fields:
* "new_value": the new format to use
* "old_value": the original value you were given
* "reasoning": a description of your logic

User: given the value "Vermont", create the appropriate filter value for a field with the description: "Two character state code, ex MA for Massachusetts"
System:
{% raw %}
{"new_value": "VT",
"old_value": "Vermont",
"reasoning": "VT is the two letter state code for Vermont"}
{% endraw %}
{%%} endraw %}
User: Given the value {{ tokens }}, create the appropriate filter value for a field with the description:  [{{ phrase_str }}]
